Addressing new questions often requires to develop new tools. We develop
statistical and mathematical approaches, implement them, and release them as
free and open-source software to make analyses reproducible and reliable.

A lot of our work uses [Julia](https://julialang.org/), a high-performance
language for numerical computing. We are developing a few of our own packages,
and contribute to the [EcoJulia](https://github.com/EcoJulia/) project on
GitHub.

We lead the development of the [mangal.io](http://mangal.io) project, an open
database of species interactions and associated packages. We think a lot about
what the best practices for scientific software should be, and do a lot of
training. We sincerely believe that good science requires good tools, and we
want to help everyone build and use them.
