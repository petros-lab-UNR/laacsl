We are interested in turning the structure of networks into a predictive
variable for community ecology; we are particularly interested in the role of
trophic interactions in ecosystem functioning.

We are particularly interested in the relationship between network structure and
ecosystem functioning, but also work on landscape connectivity, and the
transmission of both ideas and diseases. Our flagship project on this theme is
to develop networks of habitats patches, to help populations move across highly
fragmented areas.
